  <h1>Hello Coursera! It's Friday!.</h1>
  
  <div>Dear all,
    <span style="color:blue">I took this really cool course
    </span></div>
    <span>on Coursera.org. I think it's
    my favorite course I've EVER taken!
    Here is the URL for it:
    </span>
    <a href="...">HTML, CSS and JS for Web Developers</a>
    <div>
    Does anyone know how I can give this course 6
    out of 5 stars?
    </div>
    <div>
    Thank you,
    -Yaakov.... I mean a random student! Definitely not Yaakov.
